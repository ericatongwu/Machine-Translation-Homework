This is no assignment for a frivolous girl she assures him
Though brief it has a sharp dramatic edge and great poignancy
There are many such competently anonymous performances among the earlier poems
About dawn he got up to blow
It had assumed the terrifying inertia of inanimate matter
They were both very fluent
His sinuous melody is a sort of naive transcendence of all experience
Confabulation has come to determine structure
Index words and electronic switches may be reserved in the following ways
With the spring rains the flow rose rapidly due to infiltration in open sewers
At no time were algae found in the mixed liquor
The bacteria formed typical activated sludge floc
Now the problem is presented piecemeal and sometimes contradictorily
While one element is announcing progress another is delineating its problems
Conceivably the submarine defense problem can be solved by sufficient forces
The world is constantly changing what was new yesterday is obsolescent today
But it must be remembered that the plan should not be oriented geographically
A concurrent effort is needed to make oceanographic data useful on the spot
These always contain metallic inclusions
Simple elongation has been treated in detail
A third volume remains to be published
Other morphological physical and optical property values are also given
The data are presented in lists and tables
The compounds are divided according to composition into seven categories
Substances all crystalline substances and other solidstate materials
Coverage of primary literature will follow
In earlier years the preservation of food was essentially related to survival
Microorganisms are often responsible for the rapid spoilage of foods
It will however inhibit the sprouting of potatoes and other root vegetables
Chief interest in radiosterilization resides in the military services
Meats the radiation processing of meat has received extensive investigation
To date the one meat showing favorable results at sterilization doses is pork
Poultry results of irradiation tests with poultry have been quite successful
Urethane foam as an insulator is also coming in for a good deal of attention
Originally the main types used were various compositions of polyesters
The single curve line represents a specific formulation in a test example
These air or gas bubbles make highly functional thermal barriers
The mixing head moves back and forth slowly across the width of the receptacle
A domestic automatic washer that will give equivalent results may be used
This is especially true for knitted fabrics
The electron optical system may be either a magnetic or electrostatic one
Measured performance characteristics for this experimental tube will be listed
Space charge influences will also decrease at increased voltages
We can however maximize its expected value
Manual leveling requires an appropriate display of the accelerometer outputs
This process is especially difficult since gyro drifting is typically random
In simpler terms it amounts to pointing the platform in the proper direction
The platform accelerometers must be slightly modified for this procedure
A precision transit is set up so that it is aligned with respect to true north
This can be done to a high degree of accuracy by existing surveying techniques
Gyrocompass heading
He looked lazy spoiled a little querulous
She greeted her husbands colleagues with smiling politeness offering nothing
You dont eat enough honey
Husky young man he said with mock distaste
Is his appetite improved
Or does he get exercise
It required an energy he no longer possessed to be satirical about his father
He did not mind the useless kindly questions
Have you got enough blankets
Closer still regular barricades of barbed wire hung on timber supports
Was it all vain labor
It could take place tomorrow night or it might occur months from now
Give me your machine gun ammo
They are also honest seekers after truth
The other patrons were taxi drivers and art students and small shopkeepers
The fear of punishment just didnt bother him
These were heroes nine feet tall to him
Poverty imposes a kind of chastity on the ambitious
At law school the same
Perhaps it was right perhaps it was just
He merely said any good decorator these days can make you a tasteful home
There was typhoid and malaria
By that time perhaps something better can be done
Hope to see you again
Two gas lamps were no more than a misleading glow
After that violence was exultantly easy
From childhood he had known all about knives
He smashed it in and tumbled into darkness
It was like finally getting into ones own nightmares to punish ones dreams
Yet even that explosion did not mean much
Behind him billowed a small pungent cloud of smoke
It was not exactly panic they gave way to but they could not just sit there
By the look of him he wasnt that far gone
For a moment boy and mount hung in midair
The blow encountered silky hair and hard bone
They were pursuing him
The walls bulged the floor trembled the windowpanes rattled
He stared at the far morning expecting a pendulum to swing across the horizon
However a boys lively eyes might rove
A flash illumined the trees as a crooked bolt twigged in several directions
Fiddles screeched a piano tinkled
They stayed at hotels and boardinghouses or at private homes
He chuckled the memory vivid
Maybe theyll stop it now once for all
Theyre doin it now
The word also made him feel hate sincere hate for those so labeled
Hired hard lackeys of the warmongering capitalists
His arm moved swiftly violently once twice
The thought came back the one nagging at him these past four days
Somebodyll hafta start thinkin
He looked over at him lying there asleep and he felt a wave of revulsion
Why couldnt they have dumped him off on someone else
Thoroughly wised up
Knows the score with a supreme effort he broke it off
Maybe they already got them
Boy youre stirrin early a sleepy voice said
Theyll toe the line
See hes already snapping it up the dumb jerk
Merely to satisfy the authors curiosity
No one will even suspect that it is your work
Who is going to stop me
Neither better nor worse
At home yes they argued
Is it because of my slovenliness that hair grows on my face
He trembled lest his piece should fail
Drunkenness was no longer tolerated
It would be well to show the populace how we deal with adulterers
A carriage crunched by its dim lights filtering through the gloom
Fists pummeled him as he staggered forward
He wondered if it wore the old anxiety or the old taut stoicism
It gave the rubberized fabric a dull gleam like metal
The feet wore army shoes in obvious disrepair
Then he  then what
He had plunged into the dark woods beyond
They did not know who they were or know their own worth
In the pity for them his loneliness was gone
It is the same ole same tell me its name
Yall wanna walk  walk he said
Yall should have let me do it
Maybe todayll be a goodnews day
Oh  we managed she said
Outside only a handful of reporters remained
However the litter remained augmented by several dozen lunchroom suppers
They offered no opinions volunteered nothing betrayed no emotions
A sleepy voice answered
He waited until they were inside the elevator and then said now what do we do
They had vermouth sitting in front of a cafe
He reached out and felt the bath towel hanging on the towel rack over the tub
Visually these approximated what he was feeling within himself
Leave me your address
The surgeon carried a cage of live pigeons
Was it a birthday ball
It was a grotesque hen five or six feet tall
Husbandry was bounded by snakerail fences and there were grazing cattle
They often threw tidbits overboard
One had to believe in final events or one was stranded in the abyss of nothing
He drove sensual patterns off carefully shaving his long upper lip
He began to pack the saddlebags
This is our singular goal
Andreis skilled eye sized them up
Ice baths electric shocks lashings wild dogs testicle crushers
He found an empty bench opened a newspaper and stretched his legs before him
His captain was thin and haggard and his beautiful boots were worn and shabby
Flies swarmed around the bowl of lentils in which he mopped thick black bread
Suddenly she was very mysterious and dramatic
We both had hangovers
Brown eyes eyebrow mustache
Oval face without an expression in the world
Exboyfriend meet exhusband
He always seemed to have money in his pocket
How about me trying to help her get her job back
They werent as well paid as they should have been
For once radicalism was a recommendation
Rector was often curious often tempted to ask questions but he never did
How many children do you have present today
Your voice is delightful he approved with a warm smile
The jaded amorist conjured up pictures of the blasphemous rites with relish
To be passive to be girlishly shy was palpably absurd
No she would not pretend modesty but neither must she be crudely bold
With his club foot he might well be grateful
Her lips moist and parted spoke his name
She sprang up and went swiftly to the bedroom
Neither acknowledged the gift
On all sides doors were being slammed in his face
A crude ladder ran down to a wooden floor
Prompted by a guilty urge he had disobeyed the order of a man he respected
The figure in the corner belched loudly a deep liquid eruption
The flatbottomed boat swung slowly to the pull of the current
They moved toward the skiffs with shocking eagerness elbowing and shoving
The third crawling man forced himself erect
Two clotted balls the color of mucus rolled between fiery lids
His sweet whisper came after great effort
Intelligence jabbed at him accusingly
He believed that brave boys didnt cry
Nobody does but they gave me ten last year
Infectious hepatitis
He travelled all over the world
She smiled and the teeth gleamed in her beautifully modeled olive face
The name fell with lazy affectionate remembrance from her lips
For an instant the old aunt felt something indefinable flash through her smile
That is what childhood is he told himself
Theyve never met you know
That would make him mad enough if he was sober
This kids froze bad
Pa dont care about the kid
He didnt figure her at all and if he found out a woman itd be bad
Heats bad for frostbite
Hes got to thaw slow
Lift dont shove lift
His head flopped back
Now hell choke for sure
She knew she was feeling afraid and inwardly laughed at herself
There was much embracing much exclaiming
We came on as soon as we could
He makes me uncomfortable
Did he ever visit here when he was a kid
You lucky kids he said
This is my hen ledger he informed him in an absorbed way
Have you got our keys handy
Next the hen was nested and all seemed well
Her legs hung down long and thin as she sat on the high stool
Fuss fuss old man
Said you wore yourself out cleaning all these empty rooms
She sounded as though they already existed
Weve got plenty of time to think about that
This coat looks like a rag heap
In a week the hyacinths would spike out
What possessed you to tell me a clotheshorse would be a good idea
Lovie you make me feel naked
How did one join them
Were you in love with that girl
Youve not seemed like them but maybe you are
Nurses training here doesnt cost anything
They even pay me six dollars a month
Such optimism was completely unjustified
Your leg muscles and back muscles feel weary
If it ever got behind me the beep turned to a buzz
It was a fairly modern motel with quite a bit of electrical display in front
Its a formality you know
You see shes on a diet
She looked at me provocatively
Kinda like a zombie
He spoke soothingly
You dont hafta get nasty
So he understood her panic
She blew her nose on a tissue and opened the coke bottle
Or borrow some money from someone and go home by bus
Where were they now
Somewhere birds were sweetly calling were answered
The car door crashed shut
Do you know where it might have gone
Did anyone see my cab
He thought he saw a pale face at a window
There were other farmhouses nearby
A foolish thought came into his head
He remembered a story he had read as a youth
He held his arms close to his sides and made himself as small as possible
Oh no not again he said aloud
Be excited and dont identify yourself
Got no business over here on a stakeout anyway
The knifelike pain in his groin nearly brought him down again
It moved in a silver arc toward his throat then veered downward
One thing he thought nobody knows about it yet
He put it in his own pocket for safekeeping
The body was heavier than he had anticipated
It snowed continuously but quietly evenly
The soft snow was deceitful underfoot
Twice he nearly fell
Deep enough he decided
He checked into a motel and drove downtown
The sheriffs swivel chair tilted back
Shed also remember if the groom died later
Have they inherited some money or something
She asked with a reportorial gleam in her eye
Come on lets hurry down before they lock up for the day
It latches when you close it so stay as long as you like
Now dont shut this door
Something else distracted him yet there was no sound only tomblike silence
Then he heard the outer door closing
Hey come back he shouted
No they could kill him just as easy right now
Except for those minutes in her room he had lost touch with her as a reality
It was awkward very awkward
Someone reasonably trustworthy
Anything to do with an ace o spades bad luck
Not when shed waited so long already
It would have been easy to identify as opium by its odor
So somebody else knew what would happen to her fathers money if she died
Well then who brought it
Take your cobblers shop somewhere else
Emotionally they penetrated him not at all
And so he walked aimless again
When he left she knew she would never see him again
Youre a taxpayer householder landlord
Got the upstairs guy he bellows
Theyll tell you whats cooking
For a man of his mass he was curiously short
Me he said merrily
Those lovely whorls he chortled
They had come not to admire but to observe
Theyre going to louse me up good
You think somebody is going to stand up in the audience and make guilty faces
He may try to phone us
Heres where luck would normally step in
Within this framework what followed was strained even macabre
He drew a deep breath
Lullaby and goodnight his voice shook
Do you know what they think of me
Weve done our part
They took it away overalls or something
Come home right away
He drove and the road wobbled familiar scenes crept past on either side
A new idea drifted in from nowhere
They were all faded
Worn through at the knees
And men also used vacuum cleaners in both rooms sucking dust up once more
Check the overnighters out
Anybody carrying anything that might hide a rifle
Shrugs met that from room clerks from bellhops
Nobody in his right mind punishes a quartercenturyold dereliction
Jeopardize it now to correct so old a wrong
Bitter unreasoning jealousy
He also reminded himself that he had an unusual number of possibilities
It was not whatever tale was told by tails
And possessed himself  how
The poor unlucky  the telephone rang
Brain examined for thrombosis clot or hemorrhage
No signs of these no gross hemorrhage of lungs heart brain or stomach
Oh the time of death
Probably around midnight give or take an hour either way
She always did before and showed the utmost confidence in whatever we advised
With her sharp tongue shed have cut his pompousness to ribbons
He went on to personal bequests a list of names largely unknown to him
Old people have their idiosyncrasies
This one came a bit high at thirty thousand or more
His salary had reached the ten thousand mark
He would offer no theory to account for her murder
Its still unbelievable that it was murder
Nevertheless its true
Could the ambassador himself be the man on this side the prime minister feared
One more muddleheaded play like that one and theyd be leading him away
In the lighted interior he saw other men and women struggling into their wraps
He could pick up another pack on his way home if he were going home
He said the crazy fool half aloud
Only then did he decide he didnt want one
Meanwhile fishermen took advantage of them to pull up whoppers
His sarcasm was followed by a stupid grin of his thick mouth and bad teeth
Widow nice sort of woman
Got a heck of a buy on this dirt cheap
The wrinkled mouth laughed revealing astonishingly strong white teeth
Hiding out like this wont get him anything except more trouble or a bullet
If she moved gracefully she was clumsy at it
Thats your headache
Soak up local color
No other visitor inquired for her that evening
We have better rooms vacant now he babbled
Two women who had been chattering like parrots were struck dumb
The clerks eyes flickered
Suppose you tell me the real reason he drawled
There is no story he piped tremulously
A thick crimson carpet muffled every footfall
Hastily the boy switched on a ceiling light
The room looked normal and even commonplace
There was no hint of a violent struggle now
The blue rug was suspiciously bright and new
Afraid youll lose your job if you dont keep your mouth shut
Were you on duty here two weeks ago
Women didnt use white face powder nowadays he recalled
They used pink tan or cream powder
A monstrous shadow fell across the illuminated wall distorted and indefinable
The shadow vanished
There was a thick squashy crack of fist on flesh
Rough cloth rasped his fist
There was a grunt curiously inarticulate like that of an animal in pain
On the bare floorboards a man lay face down
The mans eyelids fluttered
Its perhaps a mile from here where we sit
Pretty girls among them with blonde hair and pert faces
Like his glossy black hair
Oh yes hed talked about doing so
No the man was not drunk he wondered how he got tied up with this stranger
Why dont they tell me themselves if it bothers them
This favorite grievance was not the landlord
But why pay her bills
He shrugged casually
His eyes burned feverishly
Cmon he whispered floor levels about three feet down so dont fall
Well both be blowing town tomorrow so we wont be moving in on you
His suresure was enthusiastic this time
To kayo him and maybe or maybe not kill
If we left one wed have to wipe it for fingerprints
Our hypothetical other bum who killed him would have turned out his pockets
In fact nobody saw us cop or citizen
It had gone like clockwork
How safe is too safe
Shall we flip a coin to see which of us goes first
Selfs integrity was and is and ever had been
They went downstairs loaded a tray lavishly
Okay take the tray
Thatll be plenty to eat by
Presently his water brother said breathlessly
Eternity is no time for recriminations
You too were a stupid jackass until you poisoned me
Afterwards you did well enough
Mike was of legal age and presumed able to defend himself in the clinches
Anyhow it was high time the boy was salted
My beloved ward my perennial gadfly said the whining voice
Fuming helpless he watched them pass him
He rubbed his eyes sleepily with one huge paw
A range of bluffs hugged the horizon the color of decaying moss
These planets were much bigger nearly all capable of holding an atmosphere
But to the infuriation of scientists for no known reason not all of them did
Sonic electronic galvanic  all blank
Positive results start when it goes towards the hand you use to make your mark
He wasnt likely to come down with hot chills and puzzling striped fever
It looks like we did when we made blastdown
Maybe it would work the other way
Actually they said he did sleep but so shortly and fitfully that he forgot
His body processes only slowed down enough for him to dispel fatigue poisons
The buddies invariably took advantage of him
Behind him his mates stirred without waking
You are right now buddy
Why pick me for your patsy
Why accuse a shipmate of being behind this
The tapes show that
Theres still such a thing as mental illness
Her hum became a gurgle of surprise
The ladys eyes unmagnified bugged out
You people dont have adjustable vision
The good man chortled appreciatively and decided the trip was worth his time
She found herself able to sing any role and any song which struck her fancy
When she awoke she was the ship
She was ready for her great adventures and the arrival of her mobile partner
Hello anyone at home
The sudden solitude had lost its momentary charm and become oppressive
The manybodied girl lay near him
She radiated warmth and good fellowship
We can die too we can die like real people
He remembered them well from his happy period
A good morrow to you my boy
You mean a game with cards
Soon said the halfman
Thus events occurred and victims changed in appearance and new ones arrived
He remembered the last time he had eaten  actual eggs from an actual pan
People never live forever
Her eyes were glazed as if she didnt hear or even see him
No girl would go this far to fool a man so she could kill him
She drank greedily and murmured thank you as he lowered her head
Well work for our keep the boy said eagerly
Were not drunkards she said
My dress needs some work on it
Well pay you back if youll let us
We havent slept together since we started
You dont hate me any more
Now theres nothin left of me
Thirtyfive they rode at a measured pace through the valley
Then at last the darkness began to dissolve
They neither gained nor fell back
He rode low on the mares neck
A bayonet hung in a belt scabbard
The guerrilla bivouac remained silent
He kissed her also and with deep tenderness
Running around in the moonlight almost naked and slugging a man with a rock
He might say or do something foolish
They were tethered army style on stable lines
A voice spoke nearathand
Theres no chance now of all of us getting away
Youll have to try it alone
That touched off a total stampede
He picked up the powder canister and ran out
Powder flame gushed beneath the wagon
Guerrillas were racing toward him
Some tore entirely through the whipsawed post oak
The wagons were burning fiercely
The mudwagon had caught fire also
The roof of the command post began to buckle
Anything wrong capn
Theres no war on now
His legs pumped furiously his long black hair streamed out behind him
Although my shot killed his horse he rolled off the bale on top of me
His eyes were dark fluid fearful and he gave a sigh as my knife went in
You could burn down this whole mountainside with a fire that size
It took him a long time to compose himself
My father ran him off here six years ago
It might hurt you though
And he was handsome despite the long thin scar that slanted across his cheek
She seemed irritated
Youve got no business up here
You took me by surprise
There would still be plenty of moments of regret and sadness and guilty relief
A warm breeze played across it moving it like waves
The pulsing glow of a cigarette
When he saw me coming he turned his radio off
When suitably lighted what would it look like
Meanwhile spring had passed well into summer
They had chosen this night purposely
Bury those uniforms so they wont be found
After another long pause he asked how many people know who they are
Fat showed in loose rolls beneath the shirt
He lived and breathed for the mining company
Ten years ago they blew up some of our ditches
It cost us a hundred thousand dollars and thirty days lost time to fix them
The gunman nodded slipping the picture into his breast pocket saying nothing
As she drove she thought about her plan
It was there that she would have to enact her renunciation beg forgiveness
Perhaps it was all a vividly conceived dream
Nevertheless she continued to move upward
It circled her thighs exploring with its icy tentacles
Every movement she made seemed unnecessarily noisy
Lips pursed mournfully he stared down at its crazily sagging left side
And his relatively small hands and feet gave him an almost delicate appearance
Or maybe you just dont feel like a cigar
What did you mean by that rattlesnake gag
Getting the boss rattlesnake to help you
So whats this all about
Why single me out on this permit deal
You do that or take you out a permit right now
Not immediately as the deputy demanded
Oilfield workers were a roughtough lot
A rabbit punch redoubled him
No more could he defend himself against them
Why hes going to kill me he thought wildly
Beat me to death in front of a hundred people
Wait a little while
In my place youd follow such advice as you give me
Well ride out as soon as weve had chuck
They were all good men
Lighted windows glowed jewelbright through the downpour
Put on his old brown corduroy coat and it was already soaked
He was only vaguely aware of the sluicing rain
Well talk over at your office
It was secured by an oversized padlock
For the unseen ghostlike rifleman aimed a little higher the third time
The former scouts alibi couldnt be shaken
Privately he created and magnified an image of himself as a hired assassin
The rustling problem was by no means solved
There were no tracks of either hoofs or boots
He moistened his lips uneasily
Who told you to do it
Does this make it any easier coward
He wanted to show the town what happened to anyone who tried to start trouble
Were going someplace
Wherere you takin me
Honey he whispered
Like enough well all be up on top by sundown
A single kick made it spring open shuddering
Clapping spurs to the bronc he set off at a sharp canter with growing alarm
His first glimpse of the ranch house across the brushy swells told him nothing
He had not covered a hundred yards before a gun crashed from somewhere behind
A slug had torn half of his stirrupguard away
A second twitched his shirtsleeve and he felt a brief burn on his upper arm
Another snarled close overhead
Each plane carried two fivehundred pound bombs
The pilots heads looked ridiculously small
If the other pilots were worried they did not show it
Although they drew light ground fire they saw no signs of activity
Twelve oclock level
The opposing aircraft continued to come on
If any of us miss they can pick up the pieces
The clearly identifiable enemy continued on as if no one else were around
Lets take em home
Perfect he thought
The enemy did not veer
As if drawn by a wire the enemy flew into them
A large piece of engine cowling vanished
Wingman stay clear he prayed
He fought the panic of vertigo
Something pulled my leg
We were off the road gleaming barbed wire pulling taut
High so it would only bounce harmlessly but loudly off the cars steel roof
On unoccupied roadway the bottle shattered into a small amber flash
Two cars came over a crest their chrome and glass flashing
Brakes shrieked behind us
And what eyes they were
Eyes like hot honey eyes that sizzled
Whats your name anyway
Anyway it was evident what he had in mind
Hows it strike you foul or fair
Accident murder suicide  take your pick
How will we work it out
A lot of people will roam the streets in costumes and masks and having a ball
Or more rhythmically the swarthy witches are laughing
Should she wake him
So if all these beers was to get me in bed man you just spent a lot of money
He blew his nose expertly between his fingers
You shall see her at dinner
Like as if it were built of books
She took it grudgingly her dark eyes baleful as they met his
She asked smolderingly
We can get it if we dig he said patiently
Were lost and burning up already she bit out tensely
Theyll roll off in another day
In a way he couldnt blame her
She had jumped away from his shy touch like a cat confronted by a sidewinder
He had left her inviolate thinking familiarity would gentle her in time
His blue eyes sought the shimmering sea of haze ahead
To his puzzlement there suddenly was no haze
He swung up over the wheel
The clouds bulged downward and burst suddenly into a great black funnel
The cloudburst cut off abruptly
At least the wheels dug in
His wife didnt give a sign shed heard
They were already swollen to bursting
Sulphur oil and copra make the kind of tinder any firebug dreams of
The lifeboats were stuck fast
Heave on those ropes the boats come unstuck
Lets hope we come to a safer place
They were shattered
Later you shall know it better
The old woman arose stiffly and led me to a clearing where a small hut stood
Then he would realize they were really things that only he himself could think
What outfit does she drive for
Nowadays we talk as though the blitz were just a short skirmish
They dont go for bulllike muscle as a rule
He didnt tell her the truth he now freely admitted to himself
The great black leopards
They came upon cheetal deer at woodland pools
He took his mask from his forehead and threw it unexpectedly across the deck
A note of awe came into his voice
Our boy didnt chicken out no sir
Whatever you tell him he will dive
He took a big swig of his drink
It would be a colossal shame to throw away a story like this
Make it come off all right
He felt a good deal less shaky
As his feet slowed he felt ashamed of the panic and resolved to make a stand
He crossed the next meadow and climbed a tree where the jungle trail resumed
He murmured to himself with firmness no surrender
His superiors had also preached this saying it was the way for eternal honor
His comrades were all dead
The shot reverberated in diminishing whiplashes of sound
You came well equipped to die
Are you a thrower of flame marine
Wet also were the marines fatigues and the face had an oily film
Before much longer the marine quieted down
He straightened up alert now as the buffalo hunter came closer
Stay right here where you are kid he called
The kid has no manners boys
Shall we teach him some
A third shot doused the light
Hell shoot up the town
The entire length of the street could be raked with rifle fire from this barn
He sized up the situation and shook his head
He slipped outside hugging the walls of buildings and dodging into doorways
Cant seem to locate landmarks in this snow
All that time rifle barrels were pointing unwaveringly at his head and body
He strolled back to the door whistling softly hands still clasped behind him
Why aint you playin ball
They played crack the whip a few minutes without mishap
Thank you she said dusting herself off
Maybe some other day
Oh shucks the girl said
To his surprise his plan worked perfectly
He was gifted with animal magnetism and a potent allure for women of any race
Lifting her skirts she climbed in never relinquishing her grip on his arm
He saw a pintsized man with a graying spade beard and an unusually large head
Yeah seems so dont it the boy laughed hugging her close
We dont know this guy
His head came up and he said it defiantly
Come sit he repeated motioning to the piled hay bags over the pig leavings
Yeah but whatre we gonna eat
He reached once more into the carpet bag and brought up a package of wieners
He ripped down the cellophane carefully and laid three dogs on the tin foil
How come youre riding the rods kids like you
Now forget all this other
You gonna give me a drink fella
Maybe you and me will girlie but these two aint goin nowhere
Or the bay of female dogs in heat
They had slapped their thighs
He would not carry a brief case
All the while she sat there her sinewy arms swirled before her chest
Youre boiling milk aint you
Above him slid the evasive shadow of a storm cloud
What about a tea room then
She was so beautiful so valiant so pitiable
Absolution for his lie
Why lacerate the  congregation
Hed had no idea how unhappy his sweet peach had been
If he ever did such a thing again shed die of shame
He swung in through his own wide gateway
No temptation no virtue
Go change your shoes before you turn around
He then offered his own estimate of the weather which was unenthusiastic
He scowled at her flowers
My dad did it and he lived to a great age
Ran away on a black night with a lawful wedded man
Left mine many a time only she never knew it
He gave a short hard laugh and looked at her knowingly
But she suffered in her offduty hours
Then after a while she went to her mirror
Just why anybody should wish to start a riot the executive officer didnt know
He may not rise to the heights but he can get by and eventually be retired
See you in about an hour
Ahah he thought a lush divorcee at last
It gave her a lewd winking effect
Our key salesmen are in appliances and cosmetics
It sounded silly why go on
Dont forget whiskey its such a big seller
She looked crestfallen as if he had somehow disappointed the whole human race
With any luck at all he could easily find a flowerpot
But roulettes not my game
Hes a pinto and he photographs wonderfully
Hows your luck honey
Stake me she said and let me at those dice
Named after the ballet
Is there any word you would like to offer in your own defense
He saw the dangers not the glories of being identified as a mutineer
There is not space to hold or force to guard any increased number of prisoners
The instinct of discipline has been lost
He paused then added Everything on a ship is a weapon
Another field had given him fame enough to satisfy any egotist
Now the hope was gone
This tragic lad had forged his own shackles
The air smelled warmish and foul
His black hat with its wide brim high crown and fur trim rode high
One white hand poised a stick above his desk
The guttural language from the ghetto stopped
Some of them ignored the texts and had apparently memorized the words long ago
His body pitched back and forth on the bench
Does this bother you
You had to be stupid or crazy or immortal
She took it with her wherever she went she chose it
Here they did not need to be in ghettos
All his family was dead except for his son
You feel him every mile further away
Each of us had his own specialty besides
The eye is all inward or outward
Why should this suddenly assail her
Then the telephoning began
Was it a hysterical release from the long strain of vigilance of those weeks
It was nobodys fault
She overplayed her hand
Why put such a high value on being top dog
Why are you trying to worry me
Was she just naturally sloppy about everything but her physical appearance
But it was a hopeful sign he told himself
When they got home at midnight she was tired out
Look somewhere else
Lets be fine superior people of great dignity he said as if he were joking
Then he fled not waiting to see if she minded him or took notice of his cry
He sank back sighing and was soon asleep again
His fingers fumbled across the bandages
He recognized his jacket and trousers
She must have put his clothes in the closet
He was kneeling to tie his shoelaces
His fingers felt absurdly thick and clumsy
Who would take over
For a moment he felt like a thief discovered
Her face seemed to float in an implausibly bright shaft of sunlight
He had never felt particularly close to her
Forget we ever knew what
His voice seemed thick and purposeless
Are you positive youll be all right by yourself
Take care of yourself then
No really right as rain
Look sweetheart some fool was
A smile pulled at the lower strip of adhesive tape
They make us conformists look good
Upstairs busy feet showering like raindrops pattered around her room
His dark brows which had been lowered in anger smoothed
How long would it be occupied
Strength began to zip up and down his chest
He wadded his sweat shirt into a ball and stripped down to his swimming trunks
Aw shut up he said
Shivering he put on his clothes
Watch it big shot a hoarse voice yelled back
She was holding on to his rock with one hand
Her cough sounded like cloth ripping
My mother never wops me
She spouted a mouthful of water into the air
Part collie part wirehaired terrier
Naturally curly hair runs in my family
Books are for schnooks
Either that or a veterinarian
She said sharks have no bones and shrimp swam backward
Her face turned pink with pleasure and a smothered cough
He daydreamed on the rock while she swam and splashed around
He says hell be here on the oneoclock plane
You saw them always together those years
Now you know she couldve but she isnt that kind of girl
She didnt even give me a chance to refuse
But now she looked ugly
Now maybe theyd realize that life can be tough
He had fallen into a soft job and now the job was gone and he was stranded
Virus infection nothing
A profession that brought me as good an income as mine wasnt to be sneezed at
The ward was a small one four beds kept reserved for female alcoholics
But if she wasnt interested shed just go back to the same life shed left
Will you tell me why
She went on disregarding my protests
Just let me die in peace
A long long way down
The reasons for this dive seemed foolish now
Pretty soon a woman came along carrying a folded umbrella as a walking stick
She saw me and sat down beside me three feet away
Not good looking but selfconfident and wise so that it made her attractive
As we ate we talked
Yes because you didnt run off to use that new toothbrush
A bullet she answered
No return address whatsoever
He was full of heavy family reminiscence
The rides were tame enough  mostly we talked
Somebody with no vices
And never show my face or my truck around here again
It was as blissful and fulfilling a night as any bride ever experienced
Its never wrong if love is real
Hed not only told me so hed proved it
No price is too high when true love is at stake
Share bath maybe  but share refrigerator
The red pills are a vitaminandiron compound
This is a sleeping capsule
You young men get to be my age you wont take flu so lightly
In these damp circumstances he was an oddson bet to develop pneumonia
Fine day after tomorrow she added
Rundown ironpoor
But then redheads are often pale
Youre having a miserable time arent you
Suppose whatshisname got a sunburn
Hows your sunburn now
When he finally did he had to duck his head quickly away as the pitch came in
They were both walking towards each other unhurried
Fights sprang up and were quickly squelched
Why the hell didnt you come out when you saw them gang up on me
Nobody else did either
You dont belong in professional baseball
Now dont tell me what a good ball player you are
Baseballs no cinch
His lips felt glued together
The leagues are full of guys like that
Why not try another club
He needs outfielders bad
Twentytwo or twentythree
Snakes are ugly he said again
Nobody likes snakes
He could take the advice or leave it
Real bright along those lines you might say
Weakness in leadership
She always could sense the shag end of a woolly day
Did you know he is advertising his hamradio equipment for sale this weekend
All your wishful thinking wont change that
He had always been a messy and negligent man
Half slyly he enjoyed seeing her stoop to lift the things
More he could take at leisure
Quietly he determined to foil her
He swung around eyes toward the bedroom some fifteen feet away
Suppose he ran up the white flag altogether
But his resolution hardly seemed to help
You were in a hurry werent you
The tale he thought would become less gay
Heavy industry slanted toward inexhaustible government coffers attracted him
Were here to transact business
Weve all been rich and spoiled long enough to hate the machine age
Nobody else showed pleasure
Hello boss he said and grinned
That worm a murderer
His manhood had been attacked
Joking stopped and everyone gathered around
Needless to say my art suffered drastically during this turbulent period
Could it do otherwise
Dogs did something to ones ego
Add things as you find you need em
Perhaps one bored holes in the stone with some kind of an electric gadget
It all seemed rather hopeless
No he didnt know of any handymancarpenter
It all did look very efficient and shipshape
One species of ambiguity tries to baffle by interweaving repetition
Another stock vaudeville gag ran mother is home sick in bed with the doctor
View takes in five counties two bedrooms
Officials meet on rubbish
Many shapes in bathtubs
Samples he walked in upon her invitation
Not without good reason has the anatomical been called jocular journalese
In news items a man is less often shot in the body or head than in the suburbs
A woman met a famous author at a literary tea
The girl nodded understandingly
Yes sir she said is that definite
Of course dear she said
Another brand of indefinite reference arises out of the use of the double verb
Finally he asked do you object to petting
Ambiguity arises when the pronoun it carries a twofold reference
That is only partly nonnonsense he began
Is it anything like cookedover oatmeal
Those were especially the ones that all other grownups laughed at loudest
Just long enough to make you feel important
Their curiosity went happily out of bounds
Yes maam the children chorused heartily
One could hear a very faint ladylike sigh of relief
As a result he was persuaded out to dinner
Sometimes he coincided with my fathers being at home
My mother was beside herself with curiosity
Very peculiar retribution indeed seems to overtake such jokers
Whosoever violates our rooftree the legend states can expect maximal sorrow
In short and to borrow an arboreal phrase slash timber
Now hes bought it said my wife contentedly
As you can count on me to do the same
Yes maam it sure was
I always say youve got a wonderful husband Miss Margaret
May I get some more cookies Nora
Well wait until you finish what youve got Davy
And now Nora  dont you encourage him
Why Nora the very idea
Nora I think you imagine it
Well Junior didnt he eat only one and Mr
But everybody calls you Junior
Junior what on earths the matter with you
Davy Mathews
Well I guess I ought to dust out that desk anyhow
Dont they still call you Junior as though youre about ten years old
Maybe theyre delivering the desk now
This is the second year your mothers donated my fishing tackle to the bazaar
She didnt donate anything of yours did she
He told me so today coming up on the train
When we left Washington his son Tad was ill and Mrs
Keep your seats boys I just want to put some finishing touches on this thing
Then may I ask where these muddy foot prints came from
Not very well behaved is she to run out on a play mate
Im sorry but I shall have to search this house
Oh Mother I saw them
And Nathan did he see them too
Im going to search this house
Now if youll pardon me I wont keep him waiting
I saw your horse outside
Youre to report back to headquarters at once
But Im so sunburned that every move I make is agony
May I go and get Cassandra Momma
Well there are other things to do right now
Alice I tell you my feet are like chopped beefsteak
Ive got to bathe my feet
Gosh the house does look like a morgue though
Youd think her stomach wouldve got used to it in three weeks
Yes yes well let you know
Not when I was a kid
